# LearningSpring
In this repo, I'm learning how to develop Spring Apps by following [spring.io](https://spring.io) guides. I've implemented 2 apps which are described step by step on the site.  

* 1- HelloWorld  
It's a basic api which accepts HTTP GET requests at "greeting" route and returns "Hello" with specified query parameter value.

* 2- Payroll  
This api includes all CRUD operations for the employee resource. It uses in memory database H2. The employee resource also supports HAL. Lastly, When I needed to modify the data model, I did it ensuring backward compatibility.
